            <p>Here comes the Digital Nomad! I am an Istanbulite & I consider myself to be a genuine lifelong learner
                as well as an individual who is always curious about
                life
                in
                general. That's why I enjoy web development.When it comes to programming, there is always something new
                to explore every single day.
