## A Free-style Responsive CSS Project / Cafe Website

<hr>

Tools used:
- Contrast checker: https://coolors.co/

<hr>

Notes:
- A minimalist design is preferred and it is original. No boilerplate codes are used.
- The cafe exists in Amsterdam, but it has a completely different website.
- Contact & About links are working and directing the users to new pages as requested.
- English content (slogans etc.) belongs to me. Non-English content is extracted through https://hipsum.co/ , which is an alternative to lorem ipsum placeholder text generator.
