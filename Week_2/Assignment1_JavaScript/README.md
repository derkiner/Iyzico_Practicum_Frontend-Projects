JavaScript Clock Project

<hr>

NOTES:
- The design and color choice are all original. No boilerplate codes are used. 
- As the project leaves room for flexibility, I preferred to utilise a button to show the full date.
- A well-known CSS expert from the States enabled me to conquer many animations and I used them in this project. If you want to explore more about the techniques, here is the webpage of that valuable developer: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/tutorials/animation/
