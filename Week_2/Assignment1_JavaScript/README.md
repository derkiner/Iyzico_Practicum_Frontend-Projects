## Clock / Date Project (Advanced CSS & JavaScript)

<hr>

### NOTES:
- The design and color choice are all original and the products of imagination. No boilerplate codes are used. 
- Hover over the clock from different angles to be able to change the color of the clock. Linear gradients can create magnificent shades.
- There are a lot of CSS tricks and animations within this specific project. A well-known CSS expert from the States enabled me to conquer animations and I used some of them in this project. If you want to explore more about the related techniques, here is the webpage of that valuable developer: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/tutorials/animation/
- As the project leaves room for flexibility, I preferred to utilise a button to showcase the full date.
- I also integrated the prompt part as requested; however, I disabled it to prevent speed-related issues on CodePen.
