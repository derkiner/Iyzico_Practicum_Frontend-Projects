# Asian Kitchen's Menu

## DEMO
- This project is hosted here => https://asian-menu.netlify.app/


<hr>

## Features:
- Clean Code Principles (Detailed Notes & Meaningful Variable Names)
- The content is the same as requested, but there is some more CSS styling on the existing project.
- In CSS, 'px' values are replaced with 'rem' ones on purpose
(Reason: It is known that 'rem' figures are more responsive compared to 'px' values. Here is my article / detailed analysis on this topic: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/override-root-font-size-for-a-better-user-experience/)
